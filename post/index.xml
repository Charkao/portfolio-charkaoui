      <description>Managing pedestrian flows (in normal or non-normal periods) and minimizing the risks of jostling are major issues in the field of mobility. The goal of my internship is to develop an original device that will allow to solve this issue : a vest to measure contacts and pressures, but also distances, using force sensors as well as ultrasonic sensors.
1. Introduction:
As the world&amp;rsquo;s population increases, mass gatherings such as religious or political events, air shows, rock concerts, and outdoor celebrations are becoming more frequent and attracting more and more participants from around the world.</description>
